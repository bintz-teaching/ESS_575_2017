\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability of Bayesian methods to handle hierarchical models in an unusually
 tidy way is why they are becoming the first choice for complex problems
 in ecology and conservation biology, problems with multiple unknowns, sources
 of data and sources of uncertainty.
 Recall that the posterior distribution of all of the unobserved quantities
 is proportionate to the joint distributions of the unobserved quantities
 and the data:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\big[\bm{\theta}\mid\mathbf{y}\big]\propto\underbrace{\big[\bm{\theta},\mathbf{y}\big]}_{\mathclap{\text{Factor into sensible parts}}}
\]

\end_inset

It follows that the starting point for developing hierarchical models is
 to write a properly factored expression for the proportionality between
 the posterior and joint distribution of the observed and unobserved quantities.
 Properly means that the expression for the factored joint distribution
 obeys the chain rule of probability after assumptions about independence
 have been made.
 Bayesian networks, also called directed acyclic graphs (or, unattractively
 in my view, DAGs), offer a way to visually assure that your model does
 so.
 This will be true if there is one unknown and one data set or one hundred
 unknowns and ten data sets.
 This factored expression is all that is required to specify a

 MCMC algorithm or to write code in one of the current software packages
 that sample from the marginal posterior distributions, JAGS, STAN, OpenBUGS
 etc.
 The expression for posterior and joint is where you start discussions with
 statistical colleagues.
 It must be included in all papers and proposals using Bayesian methods
 because it communicates virtually everything about where your inferences
 come from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning to write proper mathematical and statistical expressions for Bayesian
 models is 90 percent of the battle of learning how to do Bayesian analysis.
 We will return to this battle time and time again during this course.
 In this exercise, we begin to learn the vital skill of model building.
 The problems increase in difficulty as we proceed, so it will be important
 to understand what you did right and wrong before you proceed to the next
 problem.
 In addition to practice drawing Bayesian networks and writing posterior
 and joint distributions, the problems will challenge you to:

Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each problem below, draw the Bayesian network, write the posterior and
 joint distributions using generic bracket notation with appropriate products.
 Next, choose specific distributions following the general flow that I illustrat
ed in the Light Limitation of Trees lecture.
 At this point, don't worry too much about the specific forms for prior
 distributions.
 We will learn more about composing these as the course proceeds.
 You may use uniform distributions with bounds that are vague for non-negative
 parameters.
 Use normal distributions centered on zero with large variances for real-valued
 parameters.
 Again, don't sweat this too much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Work in groups to allow discussion and to teach each other.
 Prepare a write up, one per group.
 You may use pencil and paper for drawing DAGs and writing models.
 I don't want you to struggle with LaTeX at the same time you are struggling
 with model building.
 Scan your drawings and equations and turn them in as a pdf.

 We will go over the problems in class on Tuesday 3/7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I urge you to do a problem as completely as you possibly can, then consult
 the answer before going to the next problem.
 Don't correct your answer after consulting mine because I need to see how
 your are doing.
 The point is not to get the model right the first time, but rather to learn
 by trying to get it right.

The Kuznets effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are interested in modeling the relationship between per capita income
 and an index of air pollution for 80 nations around the world.
 You hypothesize that air pollution increases then declines as per capita
 income increases (i.e., the Kuznets effect).
 Choose a deterministic model to represent this humped relationship.
 The response, an air pollution index, and the predictor variable, income,
 are based on a sample of observations from each country.
 You have data on the mean (and the standard deviation of the mean) for
 each country's air pollution index, a continuous, non-negative response
 variable.
 You also have a mean and a standard deviation of the mean for each county's
 income, which is also continuous and non-negative.
 How would you model the effect of income on air pollution to include uncertaint
y in the response and the predictor?

Hint â€“ Think of the response and predictor data as arising from distributions
 of means with known standard deviations.
 You want to use the unobserved means of those distributions in your model
 of the Kuznets effect.

Notes:
\series default
 We use an exponentiated, quadratic model to represent our hypothesis to
 assert that the prediction of pollution is a humped function of income
 and is strictly non-negative.
 A linear model (not exponentiated) would have been a reasonable alternative.
 We could have moment matched the lognormal distribution for 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i},w_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

, but we must be careful to moment match for 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 parameters in this case.
 Matching for the mean alone will give the wrong answer (badly wrong).
 This is to say that moment matching for the first parameter using the log
 of the median would not work.
 Why? Because the second parameter is on the log scale and your standard
 deviations are on the exponential scale.
 We also could have used models like
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\log(z_{i}) & \sim & \textrm{\text{normal}}\left(\log(g\big(\alpha,\bm{\beta},w_{i}\big)),\sigma_{p}^{2}\right)\\
\log(y_{i}) & \sim & \text{normal}(\log(z_{i}),sd_{y,i}^{2})\\
\log(x_{i}) & \sim & \text{normal}(\log(w_{i}),sd_{x,i}^{2})\\

\begin_layout Standard
You might be tempted to use the data to put informative priors on 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 as in the incorrect Bayesian network below.
 This just doesn't work because now the 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are arising from conflicting distributions, one with parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i},sd_{y,i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the other with parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\alpha,\bm{\beta},w_{i}),\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

, leading to a violation of the chain rule of probability because the 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 appear twice on the left hand side of conditioning.
 You could not fit this model.

Your major professor objected to your assumption of cover observed perfectly
 by eye, insisting, reasonably I think, that you develop a data model relating
 your ocular estimate to the true cover in a plot.
 So, you obtained visual estimates of cover paired with the actual proportion
 of vegetated area (measured using small sub-plots) on 15 10 x 10 m plots.
 After days of sweaty labor, you regressed visual estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 on the true cover 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{i})$
\end_inset

 and developed a calibration equation 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\bm{\alpha},z_{i})$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
h(\bm{\alpha},z_{i}) & = & \frac{e^{\alpha_{o}+\alpha_{1}z_{i}}}{1+e^{\alpha_{o}+\alpha_{1}z_{i}}}\\
x_{i} & \sim & \text{beta}\big(m(h(\bm{\alpha},z_{i}),\varsigma^{2})\big)\\
\alpha_{o} & \sim & \text{\text{normal}(.05,.006)}\\
\alpha_{1} & \sim & \text{normal}(1.07,.13)\\
\varsigma^{2} & \sim & \text{inverse gamma}(10.2,630)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\,)$
\end_inset

 returns parameters of the beta distribution given moments as inputs.
 Include the calibration equation in your model of effects of soil water
 and herbaceous cover on seedling establishment using informed priors on
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0},\alpha_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varsigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 Hintâ€“think about the predictor variable for herbaceous cover.
 Do you want to use the observed value of cover 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 or the true value 
\begin_inset Formula $(z_{i})$
\end_inset

 to model its effect on establishment?

Now presume that the 100 plots are arranged in 5 different stream reaches,
 20 plots in each reach.
 You have data on peak runoff in each of the reaches, which you may assume
 is measured perfectly.
 Describe verbally how you might model variation at the catchment scale
 created by peak runoff.

You could allow each stream reach to have its own intercept (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0,j}$
\end_inset

), which you model as a linear or non-linear function of data of peak runoff.
